## Getting Started

Get started by [installing the application](./getting-started/installation) or jump straight to the [basic controls guide](./getting-started/basic-controls).

## Architecture

The application follows a strict **self-contained module architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core** - Machine control functionality and business logic
- **Services** - Cross-module services and state management  
- **UI** - User interface components organized by feature
- **Views** - Application screens and routing
- **Utils** - Pure utility functions
