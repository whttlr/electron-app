# Rollback Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for rolling back the CNC Control application to a previous stable version in case of deployment issues or critical bugs discovered in production.

## When to Rollback

### Immediate Rollback Triggers ‚ö†Ô∏è

Execute immediate rollback if any of these conditions occur:

- **Critical Security Vulnerability**: Security breach or vulnerability discovered
- **Complete Application Failure**: Application is completely unavailable for >5 minutes
- **Data Corruption**: Any sign of data corruption or data loss
- **High Error Rate**: Error rate >10% for >5 minutes
- **Severe Performance Degradation**: Response time >5 seconds for >10 minutes
- **Critical Feature Failure**: Core CNC functionality not working

### Consider Rollback Triggers üü°

Evaluate for rollback if these conditions persist:

- **Moderate Error Rate**: Error rate >5% for >15 minutes
- **Performance Issues**: Response time >2 seconds for >30 minutes
- **Feature Degradation**: Important features not working properly
- **User Complaints**: Significant increase in user-reported issues
- **Memory Leaks**: Uncontrolled memory growth

## Rollback Decision Matrix

| Severity | Duration | Error Rate | Response Time | Action |
|----------|----------|------------|---------------|--------|
| Critical | Any | >10% | >5s | Immediate Rollback |
| High | >5 min | >5% | >2s | Immediate Rollback |
| Medium | >15 min | >2% | >1s | Consider Rollback |
| Low | >30 min | >1% | >500ms | Monitor & Assess |

## Rollback Types

### 1. Automatic Rollback

Triggered by monitoring systems when critical thresholds are exceeded.

```bash
# Automatic rollback via monitoring alert
curl -X POST https://api.cnc-control.com/rollback/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ROLLBACK_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"reason": "high_error_rate", "severity": "critical"}'
```

### 2. Manual Rollback

Executed by operations team when issues are detected.

```bash
# Quick rollback to previous version
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh

# Rollback to specific version
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh 15

# List available rollback targets
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh --list
```

### 3. Emergency Rollback

For critical situations requiring immediate action.

```bash
# Emergency rollback (skips confirmations)
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh --force --no-monitoring

# Fastest possible rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/cnc-control-production -n cnc-control
```

## Rollback Procedures

   - [ ] Verify performance metrics
   - [ ] Check user access

### Step 4: Post-Rollback Verification ‚úÖ

**Time Limit: 15 minutes**

1. **Functional Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run automated smoke tests
   npm run test:smoke:production
   
   # Manual critical path testing
   curl -f https://cnc-control.com/health
   curl -f https://cnc-control.com/api/cnc/status
   ```

2. **Performance Validation**
   - [ ] Response times normal (<500ms)
   - [ ] Error rate acceptable (<1%)
   - [ ] Memory usage stable
   - [ ] CPU usage normal

## Rollback Commands Quick Reference

### Basic Commands

```bash
# List available rollback targets
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh --list

# Rollback to previous version
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh

# Rollback to specific revision
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh 15

# Dry run (see what would happen)
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh --dry-run

# Force rollback (no confirmations)
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh --force
```

### Emergency Commands

```bash
# Emergency rollback (fastest)
kubectl rollout undo deployment/cnc-control-production -n cnc-control

# Check rollback status
kubectl rollout status deployment/cnc-control-production -n cnc-control

# Scale down if needed
kubectl scale deployment cnc-control-production --replicas=0 -n cnc-control

```

## Database Rollback Considerations

### When Database Changes Are Involved

If the deployment included database migrations:

1. **Assess Migration Impact**
   - [ ] Were migrations destructive?
   - [ ] Can they be safely reverted?
   - [ ] Is data rollback required?

2. **Database Rollback Options**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Revert migrations (if safe)
   npm run db:migrate:down
   
   # Option 2: Restore from backup
   pg_restore -d production_db backup_file.sql
   
   # Option 3: Point-in-time recovery
   # (Follow your database-specific procedures)
   ```

3. **Data Integrity Checks**
   - [ ] Verify data consistency
   - [ ] Check foreign key constraints
   - [ ] Validate critical business data

## Rollback Testing

### Pre-Production Testing

Regularly test rollback procedures in staging:

```bash
# Monthly rollback drill
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh --namespace cnc-control-staging

# Verify staging rollback works
npm run test:e2e:staging
```

### Rollback Simulation

```bash
# Simulate rollback scenarios
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh --dry-run --namespace cnc-control-staging

# Test with different rollback targets
for revision in {1..5}; do
  ./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh --dry-run $revision
done
```
