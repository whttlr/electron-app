npm run build:production

# Verify build artifacts
ls -la dist/
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Build completed without errors
- [ ] Artifacts generated correctly

### Step 2: Backup Current Production

```bash
# Backup current production deployment
kubectl get deployment cnc-control-production -o yaml > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).yaml

# Backup database (if applicable)
# pg_dump production_db > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Current production state backed up
- [ ] Backup integrity verified
- [ ] Backup stored securely

### Step 3: Deploy to Staging

```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
npm run deploy:staging

# Wait for deployment to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment/cnc-control-staging

# Run smoke tests
npm run test:smoke:staging
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Staging deployment successful
- [ ] Smoke tests passing
- [ ] Staging environment fully functional

### Step 4: Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# Monitor deployment
kubectl rollout status deployment/cnc-control-production

# Verify deployment
curl -f https://cnc-control.com/health
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Production deployment initiated
- [ ] Deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Health checks passing

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Run production smoke tests

# Check monitoring dashboards
# Verify error rates are normal
# Confirm performance metrics are acceptable
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Application responding correctly
- [ ] All critical features functional
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] Error rates normal
- [ ] Monitoring systems reporting healthy status

### Step 6: Traffic Verification

- [ ] 50% traffic routed (15 minutes)
- [ ] 100% traffic routed (if all metrics normal)

**Monitor During Traffic Increase:**
- [ ] Response times remain acceptable
- [ ] Error rates stay within limits
- [ ] User experience unaffected
- [ ] System resources stable

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (0-30 minutes)
