3. Plugin settings with proper isolation
4. Execution history with detailed logging
5. Connection preferences and defaults

### API Integration Points
- Port listing and connection management
- G-code command execution
- Configuration CRUD operations
- Plugin stats tracking
- Machine status monitoring

### UI/UX Considerations
- Consistent configuration interfaces
- Clear connection status indicators
- Intuitive G-code execution workflow
- Responsive plugin management
- Proper error messaging and recovery

## Success Metrics
- All configurations persisted to database
- Plugin settings properly isolated
- Connection management streamlined
- G-code execution reliable and tracked
- User preferences maintained across sessions

## API Fixes Completed

### ✅ Fixed 404 and CORS Errors
**Completed: July 3, 2025**

**Issues Resolved:**
1. **404 Errors**: Configuration API endpoints were returning 404 "Not Found" errors
   - Root cause: Placeholder routes without actual controller implementations
   - Fix: Created `SupabaseConfigController` with full CRUD operations for all configuration tables

2. **CORS PATCH Method Error**: PATCH requests blocked by CORS policy
   - Root cause: CORS middleware not configured to allow PATCH method
   - Fix: Updated CORS configuration to include PATCH in allowed methods

**Implementation Details:**
- **New Controller**: `SupabaseConfigController` with 15 methods covering:
  - App configurations (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH)
  - User preferences (GET, POST)
  - Plugin settings (GET, POST)
  - Plugin stats (GET, PATCH)
  - Feed speeds (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Route Updates**: Connected all configuration endpoints to actual controller methods
- **CORS Fix**: Added PATCH to allowed methods in all CORS configurations
- **Database Operations**: Full Supabase integration with proper error handling

**Files Modified:**
- `/build-resources/api/src/features/supabase/controller.js` - Added SupabaseConfigController
- `/build-resources/api/src/features/supabase/routes.js` - Connected routes to controller
- `/build-resources/api/src/middleware/cors.js` - Added PATCH method to CORS config

**Current Status:**
- ✅ All API endpoints respond correctly (no more 404s)
- ✅ PATCH methods work without CORS errors
- ⚠️ Database tables need to be created (using supabase-schema-phase1.sql)
- ✅ Full configuration management API ready for use

**Next Steps:**
1. Execute database schema to create missing tables
2. Test full configuration workflow from UI
3. Verify all CRUD operations work with actual data
