# Core Workspace Module

This module manages working area definitions, boundaries, and workspace-related calculations.

## Responsibilities
- Working area definition and boundary management
- Workspace coordinate system setup
- Tool clearance and collision detection
- Work offset and fixture management

## Components

### WorkspaceController (Future)
- Defines working area boundaries
- Manages work coordinate systems
- Handles tool length offsets and work piece origins
- Provides collision detection and boundary checking

## Usage

```typescript
import { WorkspaceController } from '../core/workspace';

// Workspace management
const workspace = new WorkspaceController(config);
const isInBounds = workspace.checkBounds(position);
```

## Dependencies
- Configuration service for workspace dimensions
- Positioning module for coordinate calculations
- Machine module for hardware limits

## Testing
Tests verify boundary calculations, coordinate system transformations, and collision detection algorithms using geometric test cases.
